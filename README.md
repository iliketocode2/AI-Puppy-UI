# AI Puppy

## About
The goal of this project is to have students learn about training and coding different AI models through interactive lessons on our website. Each lesson requires students to build a puppy-like robot using a Lego Spike Prime, attaching various sensors and parts to the robot. Over the course of six lessons, students will develop an understanding of 1D-K Learning and Linear Regression. 

This project is planned to scale to future placemats, built by the Tufts CEEO.


## Overview
The site includes many similar features of the Lego Spike IDE:
- Live sensor readings
- Download and uplaod code onto and from the Lego Spike and your computer
- Edit code and view terminal messages
