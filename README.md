## About
The goal of this project is to have students learn about training and coding different AI models through interactive lessons on our website. Each lesson requires students to build a puppy-like robot using a LEGO SPIKE™ Prime, attaching various sensors and parts to the robot. Over the course of six lessons, students will develop an understanding of 1D K-Nearest Neighbor and Linear Regression. 

This project is planned to scale to future Placemats, built by the Tufts CEEO.

## Using this tool
1. Visit the [website](https://iliketocode2.github.io/AI-Puppy-UI/).
2. Connect a SPIKE™ Prime to your computer using a micro usb to usb-c or micro usb to usb cord.
3. Press the 'Connect' button and follow prompts to download the proper file for each lesson and run and edit your code.

## Overview
At the top of each page the current lesson name, lesson tips, and lesson tricks are displayed. Each page features the exact sensors/motors needed to complete each lesson. Finally, extension questions are below the code editor.

In addition to the lesson-specific features, this site includes many similar features of the LEGO SPIKE™ IDE:
- Live sensor readings
- The ability to download and upload code onto and from the LEGO SPIKE™ Prime and your computer
- Code editor and terminal messages
